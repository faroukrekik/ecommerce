# Category-Based Product Filtering System

## üéØ Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive category-based product filtering system for your ecommerce site. Now when users click on any category from the home page, they'll be taken to a dedicated page showing all products in that category with advanced filtering and search capabilities.

## ‚ú® New Features Added

### 1. **Category Pages**

- Dedicated pages for each product category
- URL structure: `/category/:categoryName`
- Example: `/category/Smartphones`, `/category/Laptops`

### 2. **Advanced Filtering System**

- **Search**: Find products by name or description
- **Price Range**: Filter by minimum and maximum price
- **Sorting**: Sort by name, price (low to high/high to low), rating
- **Category Navigation**: Quick switch between categories

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**

- **Pagination**: 12 products per page with navigation
- **Loading States**: Spinner while fetching data
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all devices
- **Active Filters Display**: Shows current applied filters

### 4. **Sample Products Database**

- 25+ sample products across 4 categories
- Realistic product data with images, prices, and descriptions
- Categories: Smartphones, Laptops, Gaming, Accessories

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install react-icons
```

### Step 2: Seed the Database

Run the seeding script to add sample products:

```bash
node seedProducts.js
```

This will add 25+ products across different categories to your database.

### Step 3: Start Your Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm start
```
